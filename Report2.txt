Used Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier to classify normal and abnormal patients
from test data provided with a well defined class. First read the training data, 
and calculating prior probabilities for the two classes (C1 = Normal, C2 = Abnormal), 
then split the data rows according to these classes into two and stored them. 
For performance purposes, computed class-based likelihoods of all data rows for training data
and stored them inside a dictionary for memoization during test mode.

On test mode, test rows are stringified and checked if their likelihood already exists in the
dictionary created and values are memoized otherwise for new rows, likelihoods of these test rows 
are calculated on the spot. By comparing prior * likelihoods for both classes, the max is selected
as the predicted result and compared with the test label for calculation of accuracy (77.54).
